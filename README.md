# The-Ultimate-Personality-Pet-Finder

For this project, our goal was to create an interactive and responsive pet finder that allows users to take a personality/lifestyle quiz, enetr their location, and find pets up for adoption near them. This program also has the option to visit the website that is hosting the pet for adpotion. We ran into multiple styiling and API issues, however we were able to create a fully functional, practical program that makes finding pets easier.
